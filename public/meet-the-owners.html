                        <p class="owner-bio">Matt grew up sitting and boarding dogs as a hobby, bringing over 12 years of hands-on experience working with dogs of all breeds and temperaments. His passion for canine care started early and has only grown stronger over the years. Matt has a natural ability to understand and connect with dogs, ensuring they feel safe, comfortable, and happy during their adventures. He's dedicated to providing the highest level of care and attention to every dog he works with.</p>

                        <p class="owner-bio">Charles grew up on a ranch training and taking care of dogs. He has experience with high energy dogs like German Shepherds as well as large stubborn dogs like his current dog (hunting Plott hound). For some reason, he has always connected well with dogs (probably better than humans). He loves taking lots of pictures and videos of the dogs so feel free to ask him for them.</p>
